            <p>
              Yes, customers can pay with cash using Order Chimps. Your
              waiting staff can accept the order on the Order Chimps Order
              Manager app, that’s all.
              <br />
              <br />
              Customers can order extra items while they dine, and your
              waiting staff can simultaneously add items to the same order.
              Customers can pay later once they finish dining. The Order
              Chimps platform is unique, and no other systems offer these
              super essential features.

            <p>
              No, pure and simple. We are doing everything we can to help your
              business. We are keeping the card processing and transaction fee
              as low as possible. All you pay is your monthly subscription and
              1% +20p card processing fee for Mobile Table Ordering and Click
              &amp; Collect modules. The Delivery module charges a 1.5%
              transaction fee in addition to the card processing fee. You can
              set delivery fees based on distance or order size from the
              ordering customer, with complete control over the set-up via
              Control Hub.
