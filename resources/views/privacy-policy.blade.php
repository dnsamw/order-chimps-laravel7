              to you most. It’s important to us that you feel comfortable and
              trust us with your information when you use the Order Chimps
              services (the “Services”). Please take a few minutes to read
              this Privacy Policy, so that you understand what information we
              collect, what we do with it and why.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, we only collect information that allows us to
              provide you with our best Services. This includes, for example,
              simple tasks like allowing other users to see data you choose to
              show. It also helps us to keep our Services clear of fraud and
              spam, and it allows us to get a unique understanding of what
              additional services may be useful to you, and all other purposes
              set out in this policy below.

                we would make reasonable efforts to request that the new
                combined entity or other structure follow this Policy with
                respect to your personal information. If your personal
                information was intended to be used differently, we would ask
                the new entity to provide you with prior notice.
